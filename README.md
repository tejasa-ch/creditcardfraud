# creditcardfraud
We are given a dataset containing the transactions between people, the information that they are fraud or not, and we are asked to differentiate between them. Intent here is to tackle this situation by building classification models to classify and distinguish fraud transactions. Dataset is too big in size so it is not uploaded here also it contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation
